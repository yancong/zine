This zine contains two stories and can be read both ways: one story about diasporic cooking with radical ingredient substitution as adaptive tactics; one story about the ubiquitous yet mysterious restaurant chain Shaxian Delicacies.

Both stories were previously published in Chaoyang Trap, a newsletter about internet culture in China: [S02 Episode 6: Hot Dry Noodle Takes](https://chaoyang.substack.com/p/shaxian-radicalism)

The zine comes with a bonus recipe insert that's previously not included in the newsletter. It's a collection of recipes for ingredient substitution cooking.
